make sure you have installed visual studio (2022) and have this all packages :
1.data storage and processing build tools.
2.asp.net and web development.
3.azure development (optional)

*after clone the project to your machine go to (BusinessCard.API => appsettings.json) and assign the Host on ConnectionString line like the Hostname on your database(look to databast_instruction.md)
on my pc the host is (192.168.1.8) 
maybe your pc difference (this iformation is very importent to make the connection between api project and database)
